                        Hey there, I’m John Gallagher. Born in Tucson, AZ, I moved to Matthews, NC, at 12 and later joined the Army. As a late Gen Xer, 
                        I watched the world evolve from no computers to countless devices, sparking my interest in early websites. Life took me through 
                        deployments, four amazing kids, and a variety of jobs, but my passion for coding stuck. Now, after years of experience and 
                        self-teaching, I’m excited to finish my degree and make web development my next big adventure.

                        I am currently pursuing an A.A.S. in Software Development and a Web Development Certificate at Central Piedmont Community College, 
                        with graduation expected in Spring 2025. My academic background includes studies in Computer Science, History, and Political Science, 
                        which have honed my adaptability and problem-solving skills. I am now focused on advancing my expertise in web development, with a 
                        particular interest in creating dynamic and efficient websites.
