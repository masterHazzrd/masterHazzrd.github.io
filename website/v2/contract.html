            <ol>
                <li>
                    I, <strong><a href="intro.html">John M. Gallagher Jr.</a></strong>, agree to abide by the terms set forth 
                    for <strong>Web 215, Adv Markup and Scripting, Fall 2024 semester</strong>, with my instructor, Professor 
                    <strong>D.I von Briesen</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be 
                    available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate 
                    for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or 
                    showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as 
                    absences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s 
                    possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
                    I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste 
                    code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never 
                    from my classmates.
