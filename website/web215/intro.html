                        <strong>Personal Background:</strong>
                        <br><br>Hey there, I’m John Gallagher. Born in Tucson, AZ, I moved to Matthews, NC, at 12 and eventually joined the Army—because why not go big, right? Growing up as a late Gen Xer, I saw 
                        the world go from no computers to too many to count. Somewhere along the way, I got hooked on early websites and thought, “Hey, I could do that!”<br><br> Life happened (including four 
                        amazing kids and a stint in the military), but my love for coding stuck around. During my first deployment, a buddy suggested I try building a webpage, and boom—my interest in web 
                        development was born. I taught myself a little HTML and CSS but had to put the deep dive on hold to handle, well, life.<br><br> Now, after working everywhere from McDonald’s to IT in the 
                        Army, I’m back, ready to finish my degree and make web development my next big adventure.

                        <strong>Academic background:</strong>
                        <br><br>Academically, I’ve been on quite the adventure. I’m currently working on my A.A.S. in Software Development and a Web Development Certificate at Central Piedmont Community College, set to 
                        graduate in Spring 2025 (fingers crossed). Before that, I bounced between degrees in Computer Science, History, and Political Science at UNCC—because why settle for one challenge when you 
                        can juggle three?<br><br> While my academic journey hasn’t exactly paved the way for a career in web development, it’s definitely taught me that I can learn just about anything if I set my mind to 
                        it. Now, I’m excited to finally dive into building websites and mastering the backend code that gives every site its unique flair.

                        <strong>Background in this subject:</strong>
                        <br><br>I’ve always been intrigued by the evolution of technology, from barely having a computer in the house to watching the internet take over. During my first Army deployment, a battle buddy 
                        suggested I learn to code, so naturally, I dabbled in HTML and CSS between missions. Life, family, and four kids later, I put coding on hold, but that itch never went away. Now, after 
                        stints in everything from flipping burgers to fixing networks, I’m back at it, working on my A.A.S. in Software Development and a Web Development Certificate. My goal? To finally master 
                        the magic of building websites, one line of code at a time, and make something cool enough to show off to my kids.
