                    <strong>Personal Background:</strong>
                    <p>Hey there, I’m John Gallagher. Born in Tucson, AZ, I moved to Matthews, NC, at 12 and later joined the Army. As a late Gen Xer, I watched the world evolve 
                    from no computers to countless devices, sparking my interest in early websites. Life took me through deployments, four amazing kids, and a variety of jobs, 
                    but my passion for coding stuck. Now, after years of experience and self-teaching, I’m excited to finish my degree and make web development my next big 
                    adventure.</p>

                    <strong>Academic Background:</strong>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing an A.A.S. in Software Development and a Web Development Certificate at Central Piedmont Community College, with graduation 
                    expected in Spring 2025. My academic background includes studies in Computer Science, History, and Political Science, which have honed my adaptability and 
                    problem-solving skills. I am now focused on advancing my expertise in web development, with a particular interest in creating dynamic and efficient 
                    websites.</p>

                    CSS, which sparked a lasting interest in web development. After gaining diverse professional experience, I am now focused on completing my A.A.S. in Software 
                    Development and a Web Development Certificate to deepen my technical skills and build innovative, user-friendly websites.</p>
